# CA_Housing_Project

## This is my first machine learning project and I'm excited to share with you what I've learned and how I implemented the machine learning algorthms in a real-world datasets! 


## Objectives

To build a model that can predict the median_house_value given the inputs.


## Data Source

This is a real-world dataset from Kaggl[title](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices), it contains the information of California houses from the 1990 California census.


## Machine Learning Algorthms 

The machine learning algorthms I've tried to build in this project

1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree Regression
3. Random Forest Regression
4. XGBoost Regression


## Performance Measure and Evaluation 

1. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
2. Cross Validation
